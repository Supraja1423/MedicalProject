# MedicalProject

## Project Overview  
**MedicalProject** is an all-in-one healthcare platform designed to empower patients and healthcare providers with advanced tools for health monitoring and disease prediction. The platform combines a modern web interface with machine learning-powered predictive analytics, enabling users to:  

- Input and manage personal health records and history  
- Track and manage medications and health goals  
- Receive personalized reminders for medication and health activities  
- Predict the risk of diseases based on symptoms and historical data  
- Check medication availability in local pharmacies through API integration  
- Visualize health analytics and progress through dashboards  

This project demonstrates full-stack development, database integration, API communication, and machine learning deployment in a real-world health application.

## Features  
- Machine learning-based disease prediction from symptoms and history  
- Patient portal to manage medical history, medications, and reminders  
- Health goal tracking (weight, steps, labs, etc.)  
- Integration with pharmacy systems for checking medication availability  
- Secure authentication and user data storage  
- Interactive dashboards and analytics

## Technologies Used  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database**: MySQL  
- **Machine Learning**: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy  
- **Deployment / Hosting**: AWS / Heroku / Docker (Specify your setup)  
- **API Integration**: Pharmacy and health-related APIs

## Usage
1. Visit the frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`)  
2. Register a user account and log in  
3. Input medical history and set health goals  
4. Use the prediction module by entering symptoms  
5. Track medications and view availability via pharmacy integration  
6. Explore dashboards to monitor health analytics

## Results & Evaluation
- ML models achieve high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on test datasets  
- Portal functionality tested with sample or mock data  
- Future improvements: production-ready ML deployment, real-time data pipelines, mobile app version  

**Example Prediction Table:**

| Patient  | Symptoms            | Predicted Disease | Probability |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|------------|
| John D.  | Chest pain, fatigue| Heart Disease    | 85%        |
| Jane S.  | Fever, cough       | Flu              | 92%        |
